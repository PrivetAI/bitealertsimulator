# Fishing Bite Simulator

Fishing Bite Simulator is an iOS app designed to help anglers improve their reaction speed by simulating the experience of waiting for a fish to bite. The app offers multiple difficulty levels, tracks your reaction times across sessions, displays personal bests and daily statistics, awards achievements for milestones, and provides a fully customizable training experience—all wrapped in a modern dark-themed interface with smooth animations and haptic feedback.
